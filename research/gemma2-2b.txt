--- CODING_PROBLEM ---
Prompt: Write a Python function to calculate the factorial of a given number using recursion.
Verbose Output:
```python
def factorial(n):
  """Calculates the factorial of a non-negative integer using recursion.

  Args:
    n: An integer.

  Returns:
    The factorial of n if n is non-negative, else raises ValueError.
  """
  if n < 0:
    raise ValueError("Factorial is undefined for negative numbers")
  elif n == 0:
    return 1
  else:
    return n * factorial(n - 1)

# Example usage:
num = 5
result = factorial(num)
print(f"The factorial of {num} is {result}") 
```


**Explanation:**

1. **Function definition (`def factorial(n):`)**: Defines a function named `factorial` that takes an integer `n` as input.
2. **Base case (`if n < 0: ...`)**: Checks if the number is negative. If it is, raise a `ValueError` as factorial is undefined for negative numbers. If `n` is 0, we return 1 (as 0! = 1).
3. **Recursive step (`else: ...`)**: For positive values of `n`, we calculate the factorial using recursion:  
   *  `n * factorial(n - 1)`: Multiply the current number `n` by the factorial of `n-1`. This is a recursive call because it calls the function itself with a smaller value. 

**How Recursion Works:**

The function repeatedly calls itself with decreasing values of `n` until it hits the base case (`n == 0`).  Here's how it would work for calculating `factorial(5)`:
1. `factorial(5)` -> `5 * factorial(4)`
2. `factorial(4)` -> `4 * factorial(3)`
3. ... and so on, until `factorial(0)` returns 1 (base case).
   * Then the results are multiplied back up the chain: 1 * 2 * 3 * 4 * 5  

**Error Handling:** The code includes a check for negative input to prevent errors.


Let me know if you have any other questions or would like to explore different recursive calculations!

Prompt: Write a Python function to find all pairs of numbers whose sum is 50 given nums = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50].
Verbose Output:
```python
def find_pairs_with_sum(nums):
  """Finds all pairs of numbers in a list that sum to 50.

  Args:
    nums: A list of integers.

  Returns:
    A list of tuples, where each tuple contains two numbers from the input list 
    that sum to 50. Returns an empty list if no such pairs are found. 
  """

  seen = {}
  pairs = []

  for num in nums:
    complement = 50 - num
    if complement in seen:
      pairs.append((num, complement))
    seen[num] = True  # Keep track of numbers encountered

  return pairs

# Example usage:
nums = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]
result = find_pairs_with_sum(nums)
print(f"Pairs with sum 50: {result}") 
```


**Explanation:**

1. **`find_pairs_with_sum(nums)` function:**
   - Takes a list `nums` as input.
   - Initializes two data structures:
     - `seen`: A dictionary to store the numbers encountered so far (keys are numbers, values are True). 
     - `pairs`: An empty list to store pairs of numbers that sum to 50.

2. **Iterating through the list:**
   - For each number (`num`) in `nums`:
      - Calculates the `complement` needed to reach a sum of 50 (i.e., 50 - num).
      - Checks if the `complement` is already present in the `seen` dictionary:
         - If yes, it means we have found a pair that sums to 50. The pair is appended to the `pairs` list.
      - Adds the current number (`num`) to the `seen` dictionary with a value of `True`.

3. **Returning the result:**
   -  The function returns the `pairs` list containing all pairs found that sum to 50. If no such pairs are found, it will return an empty list.



**How it Works:**

This approach uses a hash table (dictionary) for efficiency. By using a dictionary to track seen numbers, we can quickly check if a complement exists in the `seen` dictionary. This avoids redundant calculations and makes the solution efficient.

Prompt: Solve the equation: 3x + 5 = 20.
Verbose Output:
Here's how to solve the equation:

1. **Subtract 5 from both sides:**
   3x + 5 - 5 = 20 - 5

2. **Simplify:**
   3x = 15

3. **Divide both sides by 3:**
   3x / 3 = 15 / 3

4. **Solve for x:**
   x = 5


**Therefore, the solution to the equation is x = 5.**

Prompt: What is the derivative of f(x) = x^3 - 2x^2 + 4x - 1?
Verbose Output:
Here's how to find the derivative of f(x) = x³ - 2x² + 4x - 1:

**1. Apply the Power Rule**

The power rule states that the derivative of  *x<sup>n</sup>* is *nx<sup>n-1</sup>*.  We'll apply this to each term:

*  d/dx (x³) = 3x² 
*  d/dx (-2x²) = -4x
*  d/dx (4x) = 4
*  d/dx (-1) = 0 

**2. Combine the Results**

The derivative of the entire function is the sum of the derivatives of each term:

f'(x) = **3x² - 4x + 4** 


**Therefore, the derivative of f(x) = x³ - 2x² + 4x - 1 is  3x² - 4x + 4.**

Prompt: Write a short story about a time traveler who arrives in 2050.
Verbose Output:
The shimmer started subtle, like a heat haze over a desert road. Then it became blinding, the familiar hum of the chronometer replaced by a chaotic symphony of data streams. Amelia clutched her forehead, gritting her teeth against nausea as she stumbled out of the temporal gate and into 2050.

Her goggles, designed to shield from temporal fluctuations, were a blessing and a curse. The city that rose before her was breathtakingly different – towering, shimmering structures kissed by neon light; flying vehicles zipped between buildings; holographic billboards pulsed with vibrant imagery. It felt... alien, yet strangely familiar. 

She’d been drawn here by an unquenchable curiosity, hoping to witness the future for herself. But what she found was a world of dizzying technological advancement that left her disoriented. People walked along sleek, chrome sidewalks, their attire blending into the cityscape. Their movements were fluid and effortless, like they were dancing to an invisible melody.

She took refuge in a small cafe, its rustic charm a stark contrast to the futuristic bustle outside. The barista, with his augmented reality glasses displaying information about the city’s ecosystem, seemed surprised when she asked for a "black coffee, please." 

"Welcome back," he said, his voice synthesized yet warm. "You look like you need a break. What year are you from?" 

Amelia stumbled through an explanation, her words tripping over each other. The barista's eyes widened as she finally spoke the truth – she was a visitor from the distant past, transported to the future. 

He listened patiently, his augmented reality lens showing her images of the city’s historical timeline and its current trajectory, all in the context of time travel regulations. 

“The rules are different here,” he said, “and they're strict. We need your help to adjust.” He paused, a look of concern crossing his synthesized face. "Can you tell me what brought you here? How can we best support your presence?"  

Amelia found herself confiding in him, sharing the story of her own world and the desperation she felt to understand the future. As the barista listened, he began sketching plans for a temporary archive, ensuring her basic needs while she adjusted to the time jump. 

She realized then that this wasn't just about observing; it was about understanding. She had landed in a world brimming with potential, where humanity had made unprecedented strides.  But there was an undercurrent of uncertainty – anxieties about resource depletion and climate change casting long shadows over the technological marvels. 

Over time, Amelia became more than a tourist. She helped document local history, translated ancient texts for researchers, and even mentored aspiring inventors in her temporary archive. The barista’s guidance was invaluable, allowing her to navigate the challenges of living in this futuristic world.

And as she witnessed firsthand how humanity's future unfolded, Amelia found solace in the small things - a warm cup of coffee, the laughter of children playing in a park, and the quiet hum of progress that resonated with a certain kind of beauty. 


Her journey wasn’t just about returning home; it was about finding her place within the tapestry of time. The future remained a mystery to unravel, but she had learned one undeniable truth – the past and present were never truly separate. They were threads woven together, each contributing to the magnificent fabric of humanity's story.
